      ],
      "business_angle_text": "While the recent Bitcoin ETF outflows appear alarming, they should be viewed in context of the broader market sentiment toward risk assets during periods of economic uncertainty. The $912 million in year-to-date inflows suggests underlying demand remains despite short-term volatility. For long-term investors, these outflow periods often represent temporary market reactions rather than fundamental shifts in Bitcoin's investment thesis. The SEC's delayed decisions on additional cryptocurrency ETFs also indicate the regulatory environment continues to evolve, potentially creating future opportunities as the market matures. Smart investors should focus on these regulatory developments and broader adoption metrics rather than short-term fund flows.",
