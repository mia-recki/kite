The US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that attacks will continue until the Houthis cease their campaign against shipping in the Red Sea, while the Houthis have vowed to escalate their own attacks on US naval vessels in response.",
      "did_you_know":
          "The Houthis have controlled a large part of war-torn Yemen since the mid-2010s and have attacked over 100 merchant vessels in the Red Sea since November 2023.",

        "Strike casualties: At least 53 people, including five women and two children, were killed and nearly 100 wounded in the US airstrikes according to the Houthi-run Health Ministry.",
        "US justification: The Pentagon describes the operation as a response to the Houthis' \"unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism\" that has disrupted global shipping routes.",
        "Houthi response: Following the US strikes, the Houthis claimed to have launched attacks on the USS Harry S. Truman carrier group and banned US vessels from the Red Sea.",
        "Economic impact: The Houthi campaign has significantly disrupted global shipping through the Red Sea, forcing vessels to take longer routes and causing shipping costs to rise sharply.",
        "Regional tension: The escalation occurs within the broader context of Middle East tensions related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, with the Houthis claiming their maritime attacks are in protest of Israel's actions in Gaza.",
